[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Verse]
Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Bridge]
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

[Chorus]
(Can you feel my heart?)
