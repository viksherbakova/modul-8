[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Verse]
Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)
(Can you feel my heart?)
